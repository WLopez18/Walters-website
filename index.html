            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>My name is Walter, and my whole life I've been fascinated with the workings of technology. Growing up, I
                would take apart electronics and tinker with their components, wondering what made them function the way
                they did. In high school I completely took apart a Playstation 4 in order to clean it, and managed to
                piece it back together without breaking anything! Eventually, I decided to pursue a career in tech, and
                experience what happens on the other side of those electronics, the software that makes them tick!.</p>
            <p>I attended Virginia Tech's Virtual Web Development Bootcamp, powered by Full Stack Academy, for a six
                month course that taught me to write in multiple languages of code. These languages being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>P.E.R.N. Stack</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also learned how to utilize Git and Github in order to save my work online and pair program with others
                when the situation demanded it.</p>
            <p>But coding was not the only thing I was able to practice during my time with Full Stack. Througout the
                course, I was taught that there is no one right way to do something. Everyone has their own way to code,
                and this allows for each of us to build upon our ideas together. During our pair programming
                assignments, I learned to adapt to others' way of thinking, and use our different ways of thinking to
                look at problems in our projects from different perspectives. Maintaining a healthy and positive team
                environment allowed us to bring our work to life, and paint a picture which displays our combined
                creativity.</p>
            <p>This creativity, teamwork, adaptability, and diligent work ethic is what I wish to offer you, my future
                employer.</p>

                    which contains items from a database with tables built from scratch, an admin page to
